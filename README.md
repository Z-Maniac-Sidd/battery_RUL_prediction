# RUL Prediction Using PINN (Lorentzian Fitting + DNN)
feed data into optimized cleaning file;

feed cleaned files into plottinf cells ipynb;

after plotting and more cleaning, a to and fro process, we extract IC curves from the dataset;

We use lorentazian fitting to get important information from the IC Curves;

we feed the vectorized results into the DNN and get results;
